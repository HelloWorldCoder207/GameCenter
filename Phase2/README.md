### Project Description:
Welcome to our Phase 1 Project.

As of now, the project contains only one type of game, Sliding Tiles, which is made as per Phase 1 requirements. We hope that you have fun playing this.

To access the game, Phase 1 project will need to be opened, built, and preferably ran with **Pixel 2** emulator, **API 27**.

You will then be taken to an interface where a **login prompt** is displayed. If you are opening this project for the very first time, you will not be able to login since you do not have a signed-up account. To obtain an account, kindly click on **Sign up here** icon which will send you to the sign-up page.

You will need a **username** and a **password**. Although we are not too concerned with user privacy and security, we still recommend that your password consists of, an eight-digit alphanumeric permutation so that your beloved gameplay information does not fall into the wrong hands.

Then, simply login and follow the buttons, which will take you to the **Game Center** page.

In your first run through the program, there will not be a loaded game. However, you will have the option to **save** an unfinished game and load it from this page later. In case of an emergency, the game has a **autosave** feature for every 5 move you make.

**Scoreboard** can also be accessed from the Game Center via button click. On it, the current player’s ranking and score will be displayed along with the top 5 tryhards.

After a game is finished, a scoreboard will be displayed, and hopefully you have moved up the ranks.

#### Things to Note:

- If you accidentally venture into an undesirable page, simply click on the “Back” button to get out of there. In the event where no “Back” button is found, click on the back key on the emulator.

- When starting a new game of Sliding Tiles, you will be prompted to choose the size of the board from 3 to 5, as well as the **unlimited** maximum number of **undos**. Please understand that the larger your board, the game will likely be more difficult, and your score will be adjusted accordingly so that, when compared to the scores from a less difficult run of the game, you are not at a disadvantage.

- Click **Undo** button to perform an undo. Click **Change Background** button to use an image instead of numbered tiles. Doing this will change the objective of the game from arranging tiles to order numbers, to arranging tiles to assemble the correct image.

- There are no bugs, only features. Some will, perhaps, seem counterintuitive, but, no matter how much they seem like bugs, they are , in fact, features. :)
